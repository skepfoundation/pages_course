This page will help you know what to incude on your github profile readme. All these are ideas. Use this code as needed in your profile.

On the left is what the section will look like. On the right is the code used to make the section on the right. Copy the code and put it into your profile, editing it as needed to fit you.

Note that here markdown is used. Github will also accept HTML. There are pros and cons to using each of these options. Markdown is easy to read and basic. HTML is less easy to read and very customizable. Stick with markdown for the duration of this course. Feel free to use HTML as you further your studies beyond this course.

## Description Section:

Writing a description section is very important. Here is where you can make yourself stand out from others to employers. Below are ideas of what to include. Feel free to include anything that conveys that you are a capable employee in your field.

Provide a brief introduction about yourself, your current academic pursuits, and your career goals. Mention your passion for technology and the specific field you're interested in (data science, computer science, web development).

## Hard Skills Section

This section is where you can show what you are comfortable using. As a beginner, this section can be empty. For more experienced students, it's a good idea to include the technology you are familiar with. Areas to include are:

- **programming languages**: (python, JavaScript, C++...) 
- **hosting services**: (Heroku, GitHub Pages, AWS...) 
- **frameworks/libraries**: (pandas, tensorflow, ggplot2, ReactJS...) 
- **databases**: (MSSQL, Postgres...) 

or anything else that would help what technology you are comfotable using like Git/GitHub, Quarto which we will be learning later in this course. 

The example below is table showing technology a Data Science student might be familiar with.

## Notes

Remember to keep your github profile readme up to date. This is just as important to getting a job as a resume is. This is a tool for finding work. Think to yourself, "If I were an employer, what would I need in an employee?". Whatever the answer to that is, convey it in your readme. 






<br><br><br>


-   Students will be able to embed hyperlinks and connect their profile to personal projects, professional networks, or external references.
  
-   Students will be able to create a comprehensive and visually appealing profile page that can be shared and viewed on various platforms, including Github and personal blogs.


## Adding GIFS and Social Links to your Github Profile README

- ## Adding GIFS to  your Github Profile README

Here's an image of the content that will be added in this section:
[](./images/6.png)

The Gif used in this section can be found [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/scaler-official-computer-laptop-hello-world-hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9). I found this GIF on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/), which is full of free GIFs to use.

Go to the [GIF Link](https://giphy.com/stickers/hacktiv8-coding-codingfromhome-fromhome-M9gbBd9nbDrOTu1Mqx?utm_term=) and click on the **Share** button and then **Copy GIF Link**. We'll add this copied link to an HTML ``` img ``` tag to display it in the Markdown file. We're using the ``` img ``` tag as it'll help us specify the width of the image.

In the Github file editor, replace the ``` README.md ``` file content with the following code:

```Markdown
    <div id="header" align="center">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9/giphy.gif" width="100" />
    </div>
```

The ```src``` attribute points to the URL we copied in the previous step. Since all the contents in this section are center-aligned, we've wrapped the image in an HTML ```div``` tag with the ```align="center"``` attribute.

Note: Github converts the README Markdown to HTML and renders it on Github. After conversion, the HTML is sanitized, and for security reasons, it ignores certain HTML tags and attributes such as ```<script>, <style>, <style>``` etc. For this reason, we've used an ```align``` attribute instead of CSS.

Click on the **Preview** tab, the picture below is what you will get.
![](./images/7.png)

- ## Adding Social Network Links/Badges to your Github profile README
On this section, we will be adding social network badges to your github profile readme. On clicking this badges, it redirects users or visitors to their respective social networking sites. Badges of various social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Medium(blog site), etc. But for this lessson, we shall only focus on two: LinkedIn and Twitter.

To get the respective badges for each social networks, we'll use [shields.io](https://shields.io/) which provides various endpoints letting users create and customize social medial badges. We'll use the [](https://img.shields.io/badge/) URL and pass additional parameters to this URL to get the respective social media badges.

- The first parameter we will pass is ```Label```(This represents the social network site name that will appear on the badge) and ```Color``` (which represents the color of the social network badge respectively). ```Label-Color```

In the case of our example being **LinkedIn** and **Twitter**, their color will be **blue**.

When the parameters listed above (Label and color) are combined with [https://img.shields.io/badge/](https://img.shields.io/badge/), the following URL is created.

## For LinkedIn:
```https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue```

## For Twitter:
```https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitter-blue```


## Adding a Banner GIF and About Me Section

## Adding Languages and Tools
Below is the finished sample of how it will look when finished.
![](./images/11.png)

To achieve this, add the following code to your README.md file

```Markdown
    ---
    ### :hammer_and_wrench: Languages and Tools :
```

Now, we will add images representing the technologies and skills you are familiar with. You can always finds free logos for many programming languages and tools in 
[DevIcons Github Repository](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/).

Go to the icons foldwe and search and open the ```Pandas``` folder. In the folder, you'll find images in SVG(Scaleable Vector Graphics) format. Click on any image and copy the URL shown in the browser's address bar
![](./images/9.png)

We will make use of this URL in the ```<img />``` tag and specify the ```height``` and ```width``` attribute accordingly. Similarly, you can search for other skills and include them in a seprate ```<img />``` tags.

Include the code below to your Github ```README.md```. You can Add/Remove any skills of your choice. Ensure any skill you choose to show on your repo, they should be ones you are conversant with.

```html

## Adding Github Stats to your Github Profile

Here is an image of what we will do in this section.
![Figure XII](./images/12.png)

For the stats heading, add the following code to your ```README.md``` file.

```markdown
    ---
    ### :fire: My Stats:
```
In this section, we will be adding some stats (short for statistics) about user's Github activity. These stats will include the following:
- Number of commits,
- Number of PRs, etc.

There are many open-source projects on Github that offers different stats for the Github profile. They are as follows:

1. [Github Streak Stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
2. [Github Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
   
And after my research, I found out that we will be using 2 of them to achieve what we need in **Figure XII**.

Now let's break down what each of the open-source projects provides.

## Link 1:
The first link which can be accessed with the following URL 
```markdown 
(https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
``` 
provides us with the following:

1. Total number of contributions by a user
2. Longest streak of contributions for a user
3. Current streak stat for a user.


When you click on the link, it will direct you to a page as displayed below.

![](./images/16.png)


Then you will have to navigate to the **Quick Setup** section in the page as shown below.


![](./images/15.png)

On the **Quick Setup** section, you will do the following just as directed in the website;

1. Copy-paste the markdown below into your GitHub profile README


```markdown
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=DenverCoder1)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
```
The Markdown takes several parameters, but for this lesson, we shall only focus on just two which are:

1. Your Github profile name. Replace the ```user = DenverCoder1``` parameter to your Github profile name.
2. 
3. The theme of your choice. you may include ```&theme=dark``` after the user profile name.

Here is the sample of the full link 
```markdown
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=DenverCoder1&theme=dark)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
```

For further customization, you can explore the website and tweak the parameters as you wish.

Here is the preview, with ```08***005790``` as the username.

![](./images/17.png)


## Link 2:
The second link which can be accessed with the following URL 
```markdown
https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats
``` 
provides us with the following:

1. Github profile summary statistics.

2. Most used languages. 

As shown below:

![](./images/13.png)



### Github profile summary stats:

You can achieve number 1 above by copying the markdown below and pasting it in you **README.md** file.

```markdown
    [![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
```

### Note:

Replace the **username** to your Github profile username and **theme** any theme of your choosing. You can click on **Link 2** above to explore the site for your personal customizations.

### Most used languages:

To achieve number 2, as previewed in the diagram below:

![](./images/14.png)

Copy the markdown code 
```markdown
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&layout=compact)
``` 
and paste it in your Github profile ```README.md``` file. Remember to replace the ```username``` to your Github profile username.

### Center Alignment of the stats:

As seen in the sample, the stats were center aligned. to achieve this, you can copy the code below and paste it in your markdown.

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <a href="[https://git.io/streak-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)">
    <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=08168005790&theme=dark" alt="GitHub profile Streak" />
  </a>
</p>


<p align="center">
  <a href="https://git.io/streak-stats">
    <img src="https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=08168005790&theme=dark" alt="GitHub Streak" />
  </a>
</p>

<p align= "center">
  <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=08168005790&theme=dark&layout=compact" alt="top langs"/>
</p>
```

The picture below is the preview of the setup for this section:

![](./images/12.png).



## Achievements:
At the end of this lesson, you should be able to

- Identify markdown syntax and apply those syntax to create structured and styled text documents.


- Emphasize key aspects of their profile using bold and italic text formatting.


- Embed images and links within your markdown file


- Create a professional Github Profile README.


## Practice Activity

1. List five texting formating markdown syntax
2. How can you insert images and links on markdown?
3. From what you learnt so far, create a Github Profile README file and update your profile accordingly.
4. List 5 Markdown emojis and how to insert them in a markdown file


You should now have your own github profile and should be equipped to help others make one as well. In the next lesson you will learn **Github website creation.**

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <a href="[https://git.io/streak-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)">
    <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=08168005790&theme=dark" alt="GitHub profile Streak" />
  </a>
</p>

## How to add GitHub stats to README?
To add GitHub stats to your README, you can utilize third-party services like GitHub Readme Stats or shields.io. With GitHub Readme Stats, you can easily embed dynamic GitHub statistics directly into your README. Start by visiting the GitHub Readme Stats repository, copying the provided code snippet, and pasting it into your README.md file. Customize the code with your GitHub username and preferred options, then commit the changes. When someone views your README on GitHub, it will automatically fetch and display your GitHub statistics, enhancing your profileâ€™s visibility.
Another option is to use shields.io, a versatile badge generator service. You can access shields.io and select the GitHub category to create badges showcasing various GitHub statistics, such as followers, stars, or your latest commit. After configuring your badge, shields.io will generate a URL that you can embed in your README. Simply insert an image tag with the generated URL in your README.md, and the badge will appear, offering a quick snapshot of your GitHub activity.



## What is two-factor authentication?
Two-factor authentication is when you use an additional tool to sign into your account such as a text message or an authenticator app. Two factor authentication helps provide an extra layer of security when signing in to keep your data safe. The first factor is almost always your password. The second factor is usually something that a hacker is unlikely to have access to like an authenticator app on your cell-phone.



## Adding GIFS and Social Links to your Github Profile README

- ## Adding GIFS to  your Github Profile README

Here's an image of the content that will be added in this section:
[](./images/6.png)

The Gif used in this section can be found [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/scaler-official-computer-laptop-hello-world-hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9). I found this GIF on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/), which is full of free GIFs to use.

Go to the [GIF Link](https://giphy.com/stickers/hacktiv8-coding-codingfromhome-fromhome-M9gbBd9nbDrOTu1Mqx?utm_term=) and click on the **Share** button and then **Copy GIF Link**. We'll add this copied link to an HTML ``` img ``` tag to display it in the Markdown file. We're using the ``` img ``` tag as it'll help us specify the width of the image.

In the Github file editor, replace the ``` README.md ``` file content with the following code:

```{Markdown}
    <div id="header" align="center">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9/giphy.gif" width="100" />
    </div>
```

The ```src``` attribute points to the URL we copied in the previous step. Since all the contents in this section are center-aligned, we've wrapped the image in an HTML ```div``` tag with the ```align="center"``` attribute.

Note: Github converts the README Markdown to HTML and renders it on Github. After conversion, the HTML is sanitized, and for security reasons, it ignores certain HTML tags and attributes such as ```<script>, <style>, <style>``` etc. For this reason, we've used an ```align``` attribute instead of CSS.

Click on the **Preview** tab, the picture below is what you will get.

Additionally, we will delve into creating ordered and unordered lists to organize your skills and achievements in a visually appealing manner. We will also cover the process of incorporating hyperlinks and images, enabling you to link to projects or personal works and add a personal touch with your photo.




### How to make a good GitHub profile README?
To create an impactful GitHub profile README, focus on a concise yet engaging presentation of your skills and projects. Begin with a brief introduction, including your name, role, and a touch of personalization to make it relatable. Use a professional photo to humanize your profile.
Next, showcase your work by organizing sections with project thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and links to your repositories or deployed applications. Consider incorporating GitHub Readme Stats or widgets to display your GitHub activity, lending credibility to your contributions. List your skills and technologies to give viewers insight into your expertise. Highlight significant achievements and contributions, and provide contact information for networking and collaboration opportunities.
Customize the appearance with Markdown or HTML for formatting and maintain a consistent theme. Keep your README updated as you embark on new projects or attain milestones, and encourage engagement from visitors by including a call to action. Donâ€™t hesitate to infuse creativity through GIFs, emojis, or unique design elements. Lastly, review and proofread your README for clarity and accuracy, aiming to create a lasting and positive impression for those who explore your GitHub profile.



Throughout the lesson, we will explore the basic constructs of Markdown, such as headers, emphasis, lists, links, and images, which will serve as the building blocks for your profile page. You will learn how to structure content with different levels of headings and how to emphasize text using bold and italic styles to make your page more engaging.
