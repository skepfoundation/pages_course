## Creating A Github Profile README.md file

In this lesson, we will embark on a journey to create your very own profile page on github using Markdown, a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the web. Markdown is widely used because it allows you to maintain the readability of plain text while offering the styling capabilities of HTML. Our goal is to familiarize you with the foundational elements of Markdown to transform plain text into a rich, well-formatted document.

Throughout the lesson, we will explore the basic constructs of Markdown, such as headers, emphasis, lists, links, and images, which will serve as the building blocks for your profile page. You will learn how to structure content with different levels of headings and how to emphasize text using bold and italic styles to make your page more engaging.

Additionally, we will delve into creating ordered and unordered lists to organize your skills and achievements in a visually appealing manner. We will also cover the process of incorporating hyperlinks and images, enabling you to link to projects or personal works and add a personal touch with your photo.

By the end of this lesson, you will have crafted a personal profile page that not only tells your story but also showcases your newfound Markdown skills. This profile can serve as a starting point for your portfolio, a personal webpage, or a GitHub README file, providing a snapshot of your professional persona to the world. As a hands-on approach to learning, you will actively engage in writing Markdown, receiving immediate visual feedback, and iterating on your design to create a compelling and informative profile page.

### What is a Github Profile README?

Since the beginning of this lesson, we've actually made mention of github profile readme, and I believe  some of you don't really have an idea what it is all about.

A GitHub profile README is a special repository that you can create to add a README file to your GitHub profile. It acts as a customizable "about me" section where you can introduce yourself, showcase your work, and share information about your interests, projects, or achievements. 

When someone visits your GitHub profile, the content of this README is displayed prominently, so it's a great way to make a first impression on people who are exploring your GitHub repositories or looking to learn more about you as a developer or contributor.

To create a GitHub profile README, you simply create a new repository that has the same name as your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `octocat`, you would create a repository named `octocat`. Inside this repository, you place a `README.md` file. Whatever you write in the `README.md` file using Markdown will appear on your GitHub profile.

### What is a GitHub README?
A GitHub README is a fundamental document in a software project hosted on GitHub, typically named “README.md” using Markdown formatting. Serving as the front page of a repository, it offers a concise yet informative introduction to the project. The README’s primary purpose is to provide an overview of the project’s purpose, features, and usage. It often includes installation instructions, usage examples, and links to more comprehensive documentation.
Moreover, the README may contain guidelines for contributing to the project, specifying how users can report issues, propose changes, or adhere to coding conventions. It also mentions the project’s license, outlining how others can use and contribute to the code. Visual elements like badges may be added to display essential information such as build status, code coverage, or version numbers. In essence, a well-crafted README is instrumental in facilitating project understanding, user adoption, and collaboration within the GitHub community.

In the next few sections, we'll add contents to our README.md file. We'll use Github's file editor to write and preview the changes. There are other text editor which you can use as well such as **Vs Code Editor**, **Sublime Text**, **Atom** etc. But making use of this editors, you will have to clone the repository on your local machine and run changes needed. You can look that up at your own free time.

But for this lesson, we shall be making use of Github file editor. Open the **README.md** file and click on the Edit this file icon (a pencil icon) on the top right of the repo page. As highlighted in the image below:

## How to customize a GitHub profile?
Customizing your GitHub profile is a great way to personalize your presence on the platform and highlight your work and interests. To get started, create or update a repository with the same name as your GitHub username. Within this repository, add a README.md file where you can provide information about yourself, your projects, and other details you want to showcase. You can use Markdown formatting to style your content, including text, images, links, and more.
After customizing your README.md, commit your changes to the repository. Then, navigate to your repository’s settings, specifically the “GitHub Pages” section. Here, set the branch containing your README.md as the source, and save your settings. Your customized profile will now display your README.md content, allowing you to share your story and projects with the GitHub community. If desired, you can further personalize your profile by pinning repositories that you want to feature prominently.
Remember that your GitHub profile is visible to the public, so make sure your customization represents you and your work effectively. This customization not only adds a personal touch to your GitHub presence but also serves as a valuable portfolio for potential collaborators and employers.

## What is two-factor authentication?
Two-factor authentication is when you use an additional tool to sign into your account such as a text message or an authenticator app. Two factor authentication helps provide an extra layer of security when signing in to keep your data safe. The first factor is almost always your password. The second factor is usually something that a hacker is unlikely to have access to like an authenticator app on your cell-phone.
