## Overview

Say we have a basic paragraph, like the one below. The boring gray text isn't very exciting. With CSS, there is a better way. 

> <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Porta lorem mollis aliquam ut. Quam id leo in vitae turpis massa sed elementum tempus. Ullamcorper malesuada proin libero nunc. Morbi blandit cursus risus at ultrices mi. Ultrices gravida dictum fusce ut placerat. Vitae tortor condimentum lacinia quis... </p>


Instead of this gray text, let's theme our appearance to more of a "dracula" color theme. Compare the paragraph below to the paragraph above. 

<p style="background-color: #282a36; color: #f8f8f2; border: 6px solid #6d78f9; padding: 10px;">
    This is a Dracula-themed paragraph with colored text, a darker background, and a purple border.
    <span style="color: #50fa7b;">You can add some green, </span>
    <span style="color: #f1fa81;">some yellow, </span> 
    <span style="color: #ff79c6;">and even some pink</span> 
    accents for a better theme!

- Students will understand the *cascading* element of CSS  

## Lesson

Before we get into CSS, let's take a step back. What is it used for? When is it used? How is it used? In web development there are three major languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's briefly discuss these.

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

In unit one of the course, you learned about Markdown. HTML is similar. They effectively do the same thing. Their difference is markdown is easier to write but less capable than HTML. HTML is more difficult to write but is far more capable. 

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a website. Imagine your body without any skin, just bones. HTML gives structure to web pages, like how bones give shape to your body. It tells the web browser what each part of the webpage is, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. These parts are wrapped in tags, like labels, so the browser knows how to show them.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Now, think of CSS as the clothes and colors you put on the skeleton to make it look cool! CSS adds style and design to the webpage. It decides how things look, like the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It's like magic paint that changes how the webpage appears, making it look pretty and interesting.

So, HTML sets up the structure, and CSS makes it look awesome! They work together to create websites that are both organized and cool-looking, just like putting together a fun puzzle!

### JavaScript 

JavaScript is like the brain of a website. Imagine your body with a brain that makes decisions and does things. JavaScript adds life, interactivity, and intelligence to web pages. It's like the brain that makes things happen and responds to what you do, making websites more engaging and fun to use. 

Short recap:
- HTML: Provides the structure and content of a webpage.
- CSS: Enhances the appearance and styling of HTML elements.
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.


### CSS Cascades

CSS stands for "Cascading Styling Sheets", what does this mean? It's built on the idea that you can have a blank statement that all font should be size 12 across a website. This will be true for the entire website, until a more specific rule is applied. While that rule is still in effect, another rule can be applied for a section of the website, like the customer support section, that all the background colors should be light yellow. This means that this section of the website will have size 12 font and a light yellow background. 

Now, say we're editing a specific line in this section with 12 point font and a yellow background. If we apply a more specific rule that the font should be size 16 in this specific area, this most specific rule overrides the existing rules for this area.


### How to Use CSS in Quarto 

There are three standard ways to write CSS: inline, embedded in head tag, and external. We will only cover inline and external. 

#### Inline

Imagine you're drawing a picture, and you want to color one part of it differently from the rest. You could take a colored marker and draw over that part directly, right? That's similar to how inline CSS works.

With inline CSS, you add styling directly to individual HTML elements using the "style" attribute. Here's an example:

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This text is blue and bigger!</p>
```

In this example, the style attribute is added to the <p> tag, and it contains CSS rules (like color: blue; and font-size: 18px;) that specify how the text inside the paragraph should look. This way, you're directly applying styling to that specific paragraph.


#### External

Now, let's say you're drawing a big picture with lots of different parts, and you want them all to have the same style. Instead of coloring each part individually, you could prepare a set of colored markers and use them whenever needed. That's similar to how external CSS works.

With external CSS, you create a separate CSS file that contains all your styling rules. Here's an example:

```html
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

In this CSS file, we've defined styling rules for <p> elements to make their text blue and bigger. Now, to apply these styles to our quarto document, we link the CSS file using under html in the yaml header as shown below

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format:
  html:
    css: styles.css
---
```


### CSS Selectors

**What is a CSS Selector?**
Now, let's imagine you are building a website like a big playground! Each element on the page, like pictures, buttons, or text, is like a building block. CSS Selectors are like special tools that let you point and say, "Hey, you in a blue shirt and red hat, I want you to do THIS!".

Using this scenario, it is safe to say that css selectors help us identify and interact with html tags.
The knowledge of the tags, will enable us use css selectors and apply a set of rules and styling to the HTML element tag.

There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document as shown in the table below.

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1. Universal Selector</td>
      <td>Applies to all elements in the document</td>
      <td><code>* {}</code><br>Targets all elements on the page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2. Type Selector</td>
      <td>Matches element names</td>
      <td><code>h1, h2, h3 {}</code><br>Targets the &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;h3&gt; elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3. Class Selector</td>
      <td>Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol</td>
      <td><code>.note {}</code><br>Targets any element whose class attribute has a value of note</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4. ID Selector</td>
      <td>Matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol</td>
      <td><code>#introduction {}</code><br>Targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5. Child Selector</td>
      <td>Matches an element that is a direct child of another</td>
      <td><code>li&gt;a {}</code><br>Targets any &lt;a&gt; elements that are children of an &lt;li&gt; element</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6. Descendant Selector</td>
      <td>Matches an element that is a descendent of another specified element (not just a direct child of that element)</td>
      <td><code>p a {}</code><br>Targets any &lt;a&gt; elements that sit inside a &lt;p&gt; element, even if there are other elements nested between them</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7. Adjacent Sibling Selector</td>
      <td>Matches an element that is the next sibling of another</td>
      <td><code>h1+p {}</code><br>Targets the first &lt;p&gt; element after any &lt;h1&gt; element</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8. General Sibling Selector</td>
      <td>Matches an element that is a sibling of another, although it does not have to be the directly preceding element</td>
      <td><code>h1~p {}</code><br>If you had two &lt;p&gt; elements that are siblings of an &lt;h1&gt; element, this rule would apply to both</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### CSS Properties and Values
Text styling is one of the fundamental aspects of web design. It not only improves readability but also enhances the overall aesthestics of a webpage.

In brief, a CSS property affects how elements are displayed in a webpage.

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a ***property*** and a ***value***, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon. As shown in the image below;

![](./Pasted%20image.png)

This rule indicates that all  ```<h1>, <h2> and <h3>```
 elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color.

**Properties** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.

**Values** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

 In this lesson, we will explore various CSS properties that can be used to style text and fonts. Some of those properties are as follows;

1. Color: The color property specifies the color of the text inside an element. It can accept various formats, including keywords like
    - red,
    - HEX (#ff0000),
    - RGB (rgb(255, 0, 0)), etc...
  
Example: 
```css
    color: blue; #will set the text color to blue.
``` 


2. Font-Family: This property specifies the font for the text. It can be a specific font **(e.g., Arial)**, a generic family **(e.g., sans-serif)**, or a list of fonts, known as a ***"font stack,"*** where the browser will use the first available font.

Example:
```css
    font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
```
uses "Times New ROman" if available, otherwise falls back to any available serif font.

3. Font-Size: font-size determines the size of the font. Font-size can be specified in different units, such as;
  - Pixels (px),
  - Oiubts (pt),
  - ems (em),
  - Percentages (%)

Example:
```css
    font-size: 16px; #Sets the font size to 16 pixels.
```


4. Font-Weight: Controls the thickness of the text. Some font-weight include;
  - normal
  - bold
  - bolder
  - lighter
  - or numerical values ranging from 100-900.

Example:
```css
    font-weight: bold; #makes the text bold.
```


5. Text-Align: This Css property aligns text horizontally within it's containing element. Possible values are
  - left,
  - right,
  - center,
  - justify

Example:
```css
    text-align: center; #this centers the text.
```

6. Text-Decoration: Adds decorative elements to text, such as;
    -  underlines,
    -  overlines,
    -  line-throughs,
    -  or a combination of the ones listed above

Example:
```css
    text-decoration: underline; #underlines the text.
```

7. Text-Transform: Text Transform controls the capitalization of text. The values includes the following;
  - none,
  - capitalize (first letter of each word is capitalized),
  - uppercase (all letters are uppercase),
  - lowercase (all letters are lowercase). etc.


8. Line-Height: Sets the height of a line of text, affecting the space between the lines in a paragraph. Line height 
  - Can be a number (without units, which acts as a multiplier to the font size)
  - length (px, em, etc.),
  - or precentage.

Example:
```css
    line-height: 1.5; #sets the line height to 1.5 times the font size.
```
The purpose of line-height is to enhance readability.

9. Letter-Spacing and Word-Spacing: These properties control the space between letters and words, respectively. They can accept values like normal or lengths (e.g., 2px).
  
Example:
```css
    letter-spacing: 1px; #increases the space between letters by 1 pixel.
```
