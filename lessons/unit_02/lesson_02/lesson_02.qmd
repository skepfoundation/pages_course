## Lesson

### A Quarto Overview

Quarto is a dynamic open-source publishing system made to simplify the process of creating easily reproducible reports, articles, research,HTML, and other print and non-print documents. It is built on top of the exceptionally powerful [Pandoc converter](https://pandoc.org/) and uses a language syntax very similar to [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and other flavours of markdown.

Unlike R markdown, Quarto is not tied to a specific language, infact it was made to be multi-lingual. As such, it supports Python, Julia, and Observable among others. The benefits of Quarto can be summarized as:

1.  Dynamic Documents: Like R Markdown, Quarto allows you to create dynamic documents where you can embed code, text, and visualizations.

2.  Multilingual Support: Quarto supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for different types of analysis. It's not limited to R; you can use Python, Julia, and more.

3.  Interactive Documents: Quarto supports interactive documents with features like interactive graphics and code blocks. The document output can be PDF, EPUB, HTML, DOC, etcetera.

4.  Reproducibility and Collaboration: Quarto emphasizes reproducibility by capturing the code, data, and dependencies needed to reproduce the document's content. This makes it a powerful way for people to collaborate on projects as everyone can view everything about a report on a single doument.

#### Rendering/Previewing Quarto files

-   Create a quarto file by clicking the **file** at the top-left in vscode and then selecting **New File..** from the drop-down.

-   From the new drop-down, select **Quarto Document**. A new untitled quarto document will be created with the following content:

```         
---
title: "Untitled"
format: html
---
```

-   Edit and add content to your quarto file to make it look like this:

```         
---
title: "My First Quarto Code"
format: html
---

### My name is {type your name here}
I just finished installing quarto on **{input the date here}**
```

-   Click on the **preview** button on the top-right of vscode. A dialog will pop up.

-   Name your file **test.qmd** (qmd is the file extension name for a quarto file) and click on **save**.

-   Click the **preview** button again. A few things will run in the terminal. A preview panel will open on the right of vscode. The result should resemble the picture below (Except the name and date will be different).



## Practice Activity

-   Download and install Quarto.

-   Create a new Quarto (**.qmd**) file, add the content from above, and preview it.

-   Take a screenshot of your screen (with the preview) and share to your group.



## Conclusion

Good job completing this. By now you should:

- Have quarto installed and should have created a new quarto document.

- Have a basic understanding of the capabilities and use cases of Quarto. 

In future lessons you will utilize Quarto with markdown to create web content. Quarto is a quick way to create a static webpage without having to understand HTML in detail.


### FAQ
