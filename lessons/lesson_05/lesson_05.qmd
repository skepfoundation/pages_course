## Lesson

### A Quarto Overview

Quarto is a dynamic open-source publishing system made to simplify the process of creating easily reproducible reports, articles, research,HTML, and other print and non-print documents. It is built on top of the exceptionally powerful [Pandoc converter](https://pandoc.org/) and uses a language syntax very similar to [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and other flavours of markdown.

Unlike R markdown, Quarto is not tied to a specific language, infact it was made to be multi-lingual. As such, it supports Python, Julia, and Observable among others. The benefits of Quarto can be summarized as:

1.  Dynamic Documents: Like R Markdown, Quarto allows you to create dynamic documents where you can embed code, text, and visualizations.

2.  Multilingual Support: Quarto supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for different types of analysis. It's not limited to R; you can use Python, Julia, and more.

3.  Interactive Documents: Quarto supports interactive documents with features like interactive graphics and code blocks. The document output can be PDF, EPUB, HTML, DOC, etcetera.

4.  Reproducibility and Collaboration: Quarto emphasizes reproducibility by capturing the code, data, and dependencies needed to reproduce the document's content. This makes it a powerful way for people to collaborate on projects as everyone can view everything about a report on a single doument.
