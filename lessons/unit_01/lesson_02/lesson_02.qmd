## Overview

The GitHub profile README serves as a distinctive profile page showcasing who you are and what you do. Functioning as a customizable "about me" section, it provides an avenue for individuals to introduce themselves, exhibit their projects, and communicate details about their interests and achievements. Essentially, the content of this README defines one's GitHub profile, making it a pivotal element for creating a compelling first impression, particularly for employers seeking insights into an individual's skills and interests upon visiting their GitHub profile. By the end of this lesson, you will have crafted your own GitHub profile readme using markdown.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the web. Markdown is widely used because it allows you to maintain the readability of plain text while offering the styling capabilities of HTML. Our goal is to familiarize you with the foundational elements of Markdown to transform plain text into a rich, well-formatted document.

This lesson will be but a brief introduction of markdown. In the next two lessons, you'll learn how to use Markdown to enhance the visual appeal and structure of your profile, making it easier for others to read and understand the information you share.

## Learning Objectives

-   Students will be able to create their own GitHUb profile README

3.  A Create a new repository page opens. In the **Repository name** field, **enter your GitHub username**. After entering your username, GitHub displays a message describing that you're about to create a GitHub *special repository*.

For example, if your username is `octocat`, you would create a repository named `octocat`.

4.  Check the **public** checkbox under repository type to make the Github profile README visible to everyone who visits the Github profile page. If you don't want users to see your Github profile README while it's still in development, you can choose **Private**. Once done with editing the README, you can go to the repo settings to change it's visibilty to **Public**.

5.  Check the **Add a README file** checkbox. This will add a `README.md` file where we'll add the profile contents. The field values should look similar to the image below.

6.  Click on the **Create repository** button. A special repository is created successfully. Go to the repository you just created by clicking your profile picture, then "Your repositories", and then the repository named after your GitHub profile. You'll see a **README.md** file added to the repository.

In the next few sections, we'll add contents to our README.md file. We'll use Github's file editor to write and preview the changes. There are other text editor which you can use as well such as **Vs Code Editor**, **Sublime Text**, **Atom** etc. But for this lesson, we shall be making use of Github file editor.

Open the **README.md** file and click on the Edit this file icon (a pencil icon) on the top right of the repo page. As highlighted in the image below:

Remember that your GitHub profile is visible to the public, so make sure your customization represents you and your work effectively. This customization not only adds a personal touch to your GitHub presence but also serves as a valuable portfolio for potential collaborators and employers.

In the next lesson, we'll understand markdown more so that you can format your GitHub profile readme just how you like it.

Pictured below is what your github profile will be if you do everything right.

```{=html}
<!-- <video width="800" height="315" autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="\images\v1.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> -->
```
