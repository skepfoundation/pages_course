## Overview

The GitHub profile README serves as a distinctive profile page showcasing who you are and what you do. Functioning as a customizable "about me" section, it provides an avenue for individuals to introduce themselves, exhibit their projects, and communicate details about their interests and achievements. Essentially, the content of this README defines one's GitHub profile, making it a pivotal element for creating a compelling first impression, particularly for employers seeking insights into an individual's skills and interests upon visiting their GitHub profile. By the end of this lesson, you will have crafted your own GitHub profile readme using markdown.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the web. Markdown is widely used because it allows you to maintain the readability of plain text while offering the styling capabilities of HTML. Our goal is to familiarize you with the foundational elements of Markdown to transform plain text into a rich, well-formatted document.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the web. Markdown is widely used because it allows you to maintain the readability of plain text while offering the styling capabilities of HTML. Our goal is to familiarize you with the foundational elements of Markdown to transform plain text into a rich, well-formatted document.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting text on the web. In the context of GitHub and profile READMEs, Markdown serves as a simple and intuitive way to add formatting elements to your text without needing to use complex HTML or other markup languages. With Markdown, you can easily create headers, lists, emphasize text, add links, insert images, and more, using a straightforward and human-readable syntax.

### Let's Begin Creating a GitHub Profile README
=======
## Let's Begin Creating a GitHub Profile README
>>>>>>> 63bd6fef8bffba9f70824128cb4d4a9b7d51e0de

1.  Log in to GitHub.
2.  Click on **+** icon at top right of the page and select **New Repository**.

![](./images/1.png)

3.  A Create a new repository page opens. In the **Repository name** field, **enter your GitHub username**. After entering your username, GitHub displays a message describing that you're about to create a GitHub *special repository*.

For example, if your username is `octocat`, you would create a repository named `octocat`.

![](./images/2.1.png)

4.  Check the **public** checkbox under repository type to make the Github profile README visible to everyone who visits the Github profile page. If you don't want users to see your Github profile README while it's still in development, you can choose **Private**. Once done with editing the README, you can go to the repo settings to change it's visibilty to **Public**.

5.  Check the **Add a README file** checkbox. This will add a `README.md` file where we'll add the profile contents. The field values should look similar to the image below.

![](./images/2.png)

6.  Click on the **Create repository** button. A special repository is created successfully. Go to the repository you just created by clicking your profile picture, then "Your repositories", and then the repository named after your GitHub profile. You'll see a **README.md** file added to the repository.

![](./images/3.png)

In the next few sections, we'll add contents to our README.md file. We'll use Github's file editor to write and preview the changes. There are other text editor which you can use as well such as **Vs Code Editor**, **Sublime Text**, **Atom** etc. But for this lesson, we shall be making use of Github file editor.

Open the **README.md** file and click on the Edit this file icon (a pencil icon) on the top right of the repo page. As highlighted in the image below:

## Adding GIFS and Social Links to your Github Profile README

-   

    ## Adding GIFS to your Github Profile README

Here's an image of the content that will be added in this section: [ ](./images/6.png)

The Gif used in this section can be found [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/scaler-official-computer-laptop-hello-world-hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9). I found this GIF on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/), which is full of free GIFs to use.

Go to the [GIF Link](https://giphy.com/stickers/hacktiv8-coding-codingfromhome-fromhome-M9gbBd9nbDrOTu1Mqx?utm_term=) and click on the **Share** button and then **Copy GIF Link**. We'll add this copied link to an HTML `img` tag to display it in the Markdown file. We're using the `img` tag as it'll help us specify the width of the image.

In the Github file editor, replace the `README.md` file content with the following code:

```{Markdown}
    <div id="header" align="center">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9/giphy.gif" width="100" />
    </div>
```

The `src` attribute points to the URL we copied in the previous step. Since all the contents in this section are center-aligned, we've wrapped the image in an HTML `div` tag with the `align="center"` attribute.

Note: Github converts the README Markdown to HTML and renders it on Github. After conversion, the HTML is sanitized, and for security reasons, it ignores certain HTML tags and attributes such as `<script>, <style>, <style>` etc. For this reason, we've used an `align` attribute instead of CSS.

Click on the **Preview** tab, the picture below is what you will get. ![](./images/7.png)

-   

    ## Adding Social Network Links/Badges to your Github profile README

    On this section, we will be adding social network badges to your github profile readme. On clicking this badges, it redirects users or visitors to their respective social networking sites. Badges of various social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Medium(blog site), etc. But for this lessson, we shall only focus on two: LinkedIn and Twitter.

To get the respective badges for each social networks, we'll use [shields.io](https://shields.io/) which provides various endpoints letting users create and customize social medial badges. We'll use the [ ](https://img.shields.io/badge/) URL and pass additional parameters to this URL to get the respective social media badges.

-   The first parameter we will pass is `Label`(This represents the social network site name that will appear on the badge) and `Color` (which represents the color of the social network badge respectively). `Label-Color`

In the case of our example being **LinkedIn** and **Twitter**, their color will be **blue**.

When the parameters listed above (Label and color) are combined with <https://img.shields.io/badge/>, the following URL is created.

## For LinkedIn:

```{html}
  https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue
```

## For Twitter:

```{html}
  https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitter-blue
```

## Adding a Banner GIF and About Me Section

![](./images/8.png)

## Adding Languages and Tools

Below is the finished sample of how it will look when finished. ![](./images/11.png)

To achieve this, add the following code to your README.md file

``` markdown
    ---
    ### :hammer_and_wrench: Languages and Tools :
```

Now, we will add images representing the technologies and skills you are familiar with. You can always finds free logos for many programming languages and tools in [DevIcons Github Repository](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/).

Go to the icons foldwe and search and open the `Pandas` folder. In the folder, you'll find images in SVG(Scaleable Vector Graphics) format. Click on any image and copy the URL shown in the browser's address bar ![](./images/9.png)

We will make use of this URL in the `<img />` tag and specify the `height` and `width` attribute accordingly. Similarly, you can search for other skills and include them in a seprate `<img />` tags.

Include the code below to your Github `README.md`. You can Add/Remove any skills of your choice. Ensure any skill you choose to show on your repo, they should be ones you are conversant with.

``` html
    <div>
        <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/java/java-original-wordmark.svg" title="Java" alt="Java" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
        <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" title="React" alt="React" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;

    </div>
```

The picture below is an example of how it should look like if done properly. Remember, you are free to experiment on the height and width of the logos as you want. Feel free to increase and decrease them to any size of your choice. ![](./images/10.png)

## Adding Github Stats to your Github Profile

Here is an image of what we will do in this section. ![Figure XII](./images/12.png)

For the stats heading, add the following code to your `README.md` file.

``` markdown
    ---
    ### :fire: My Stats:
```

In this section, we will be adding some stats (short for statistics) about user's Github activity. These stats will include the following: - Number of commits, - Number of PRs, etc.

There are many open-source projects on Github that offers different stats for the Github profile. They are as follows:

1.  [Github Streak Stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
2.  [Github Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

And after my research, I found out that we will be using 2 of them to achieve what we need in **Figure XII**.

Now let's break down what each of the open-source projects provides.

## Link 1:

The first link which can be accessed with the following URL

``` markdown
(https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
```

provides us with the following:

1.  Total number of contributions by a user
2.  Longest streak of contributions for a user
3.  Current streak stat for a user.

When you click on the link, it will direct you to a page as displayed below.

![](./images/16.png)

Then you will have to navigate to the **Quick Setup** section in the page as shown below.

![](./images/15.png)

On the **Quick Setup** section, you will do the following just as directed in the website;

1.  Copy-paste the markdown below into your GitHub profile README

``` markdown
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=DenverCoder1)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
```

The Markdown takes several parameters, but for this lesson, we shall only focus on just two which are:

1.  Your Github profile name. Replace the `user = DenverCoder1` parameter to your Github profile name.
2.  
3.  The theme of your choice. you may include `&theme=dark` after the user profile name.

Here is the sample of the full link

``` markdown
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=DenverCoder1&theme=dark)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
```

For further customization, you can explore the website and tweak the parameters as you wish.

Here is the preview, with `08***005790` as the username.

![](./images/17.png)

## Link 2:

The second link which can be accessed with the following URL

``` markdown
https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats
```

provides us with the following:

1.  Github profile summary statistics.

2.  Most used languages.

As shown below:

![](./images/13.png)

### Github profile summary stats:

You can achieve number 1 above by copying the markdown below and pasting it in you **README.md** file.

``` markdown
    [![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
```

### Note:

Replace the **username** to your Github profile username and **theme** any theme of your choosing. You can click on **Link 2** above to explore the site for your personal customizations.

### Most used languages:

To achieve number 2, as previewed in the diagram below:

![](./images/14.png)

Copy the markdown code

``` markdown
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&layout=compact)
```

and paste it in your Github profile `README.md` file. Remember to replace the `username` to your Github profile username.

### Center Alignment of the stats:

As seen in the sample, the stats were center aligned. to achieve this, you can copy the code below and paste it in your markdown.

``` markdown
<p align="center">
  <a href="[https://git.io/streak-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)">
    <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=08168005790&theme=dark" alt="GitHub profile Streak" />
  </a>
</p>


<p align="center">
  <a href="https://git.io/streak-stats">
    <img src="https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=08168005790&theme=dark" alt="GitHub Streak" />
  </a>
</p>

<p align= "center">
  <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=08168005790&theme=dark&layout=compact" alt="top langs"/>
</p>
```

The picture below is the preview of the setup for this section:

![](./images/12.png).

## FAQs

## What is a GitHub README?

A GitHub README is a fundamental document in a software project hosted on GitHub, typically named "README.md" using Markdown formatting. Serving as the front page of a repository, it offers a concise yet informative introduction to the project. The README's primary purpose is to provide an overview of the project's purpose, features, and usage. It often includes installation instructions, usage examples, and links to more comprehensive documentation. Moreover, the README may contain guidelines for contributing to the project, specifying how users can report issues, propose changes, or adhere to coding conventions. It also mentions the project's license, outlining how others can use and contribute to the code. Visual elements like badges may be added to display essential information such as build status, code coverage, or version numbers. In essence, a well-crafted README is instrumental in facilitating project understanding, user adoption, and collaboration within the GitHub community.

## How to customize a GitHub profile?

Customizing your GitHub profile is a great way to personalize your presence on the platform and highlight your work and interests. To get started, create or update a repository with the same name as your GitHub username. Within this repository, add a README.md file where you can provide information about yourself, your projects, and other details you want to showcase. You can use Markdown formatting to style your content, including text, images, links, and more. After customizing your README.md, commit your changes to the repository. Then, navigate to your repository's settings, specifically the "GitHub Pages" section. Here, set the branch containing your README.md as the source, and save your settings. Your customized profile will now display your README.md content, allowing you to share your story and projects with the GitHub community. If desired, you can further personalize your profile by pinning repositories that you want to feature prominently. Remember that your GitHub profile is visible to the public, so make sure your customization represents you and your work effectively. This customization not only adds a personal touch to your GitHub presence but also serves as a valuable portfolio for potential collaborators and employers.
