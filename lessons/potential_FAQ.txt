FAQ
why is the link to the quarto installation not working?
It could be because the server in your area is non-responsive. Try using a VPN set to another country (preferably, the US). You can use a free VPN extension on chrome (or whatever browser you are using). Reload the page and try the installation link again. The quarto file should download.
