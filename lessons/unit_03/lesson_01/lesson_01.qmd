## Overview

-   You will learn to create a personalized website using Quarto. You will build a foundational **About Me** page, add new sections like **Blog Posts** and **Contact**, and render your site with `quarto render`. You will also be introduced to working with to YAML files.

## Learning Objectives

-   Students will know how to create and have a basic website using Quarto

-   Students will know how to add new pages to their website and work with YAML

-   Students will be able to render the website using `quarto render`.

## Prerequisites

-   Students should have Visual Studio Code and the Quarto extension installed on their computer. Refer to our lessons on [VS Code](lessons/unit_02/lesson_01) and [Quarto](lessons/unit_02/lesson_02) if you don't have it already.

## Why Quarto for Creating Websites?

**Reproducibility:** Quarto ensures reproducibility by combining content, code, and results into a single document. This is vital for maintaining consistency and transparency in web development projects.

**Flexibility with Markdown and Code:** Quarto empowers users to seamlessly blend Markdown for content and code for interactivity. This flexibility allows for easy integration of data analysis, visualizations, and narrative—all within a single environment.

**Effortless Document Structuring:** With Quarto's intuitive structure, creating and organizing pages becomes straightforward. Its simplicity enables quick addition of new content, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced users in the website development realm.

## Getting started with building your first website

1.  Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

2.  In VS Code, execute the **Quarto: Create Project** command from the command-palette:

3.  Then, select **Website Project:**

4.  You’ll be prompted to select a parent directory/folder to create the project within. Then, you’ll be asked to name the directory/folder for your website project. For example, **Quarto Project:**

    ![Selecting Folder](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/vscode-create-project-directory.png)

5.  The new website project will be created and opened within VS Code. Click the **Render** button to preview the website:

-   The `quarto.yml` file holds metadata such as the title of the document, author information, and other details that help describe and identify the document.

    ![YAML Navigation](images/yaml_navigation.png)

    In the above image, the left side contains a YAML file that contains the metadata.

-   The title of the website is called **Quarto Website**,

-   The navbar is essentially a navigation bar that helps users easily navigate through different sections or pages of the website. Each item in the left navigation specifies a page or a link, and the text attribute defines the text that will be displayed for that link.

-   If we want to add two new pages **(blog_post.qmd and contact.qmd)** to the main **About Me** page we first create the qmd files, then add the files in the **navbar** section in the .yml file.

## Practice Activity

#### Add New Page to your Website

-   Add a new Contact Page to your website.

-   The qmd file should be 'contact.qmd'.

-   Add 'Contact' as the heading

-   Do not forget to link to it in the YAML file.

Your new page should look like this :

*You can fill out the Contact Page if you're feeling motivated*

#### Fill out the 'about.qmd'

-   Fill out the 'About' page with a description of yourself in the 'about.qmd'.

-   Don't forget to add 'About' as the header.

Your About page should look like this :

## Conclusion
