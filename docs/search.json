    "text": "Task 1 - Creating Your First Github Repo\nGit is the world‚Äôs most popular version control system and Github is the most popular site for hosting code using git in the cloud. As a version control system, Git helps you keep your coding project files organized by keeping a record of when you edited files and tags them with short notes about what changes were made in the last iteration. This is particularly helpful when you are colaborating on a project with other programmers and need to stay tidy while working on the same files.\nGithub is a free web service for storing your version controlled code in the cloud. It allows you to access your code from anywhere and it provides a handy interface for tracking your code‚Äôs changes over time. It also happens to have a handy service for hosting static websites for free on their platform.\nIn this task you will create a github account, create a repository, and clone that repository onto your local machine in Rstudio.\n\nDetails"

Simillar to HTML used in browsers, but lightweight, with syntax that's very readable and unobstrusive.\n\n\nWhy use Markdown ?\n\nMarkdown can be used for basically everything. It‚Äôs used to create websites, documents, notes, presentations and technical documentation.\nMarkdown is as beginner-friendly as it‚Äôs powerful.\nMarkdown is portable. Markdown-formatted text files can be opened using virtually any application.\nMarkdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.\nMarkdown is everywhere. It‚Äôs supported on GitHub, and lots of desktop and web-based applications.\nMarkdown is future proof. Even if the application you‚Äôre using stops working at some point in the future, you‚Äôll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.\n\nIn summary, Markdown is a handy, versatile text-formatting tool that you can use to create websites and other textbased documents, which you‚Äôll be using throughout your data science journey. Knowing how to use it will prove essential as you kickstart your journey."

    "text": "Lesson\n\nWhat is a Github Profile README?\nSince the beginning of this lesson, we‚Äôve actually made mention of github profile readme, and I believe some of you don‚Äôt really have an idea what it is all about.\nA GitHub profile README is a special repository that you can create to add a README file to your GitHub profile. It acts as a customizable ‚Äúabout me‚Äù section where you can introduce yourself, showcase your work, and share information about your interests, projects, or achievements.\nWhen someone visits your GitHub profile, the content of this README is displayed prominently, so it‚Äôs a great way to make a first impression on people who are exploring your GitHub repositories or looking to learn more about you as a developer or contributor.\nTo create a GitHub profile README, you simply create a new repository that has the same name as your GitHub username. For example, if your username is octocat, you would create a repository named octocat. Inside this repository, you place a README.md file. Whatever you write in the README.md file using Markdown will appear on your GitHub profile.\n\n\nWhat is a GitHub README?\nA GitHub README is a fundamental document in a software project hosted on GitHub, typically named ‚ÄúREADME.md‚Äù using Markdown formatting. Serving as the front page of a repository, it offers a concise yet informative introduction to the project. The README‚Äôs primary purpose is to provide an overview of the project‚Äôs purpose, features, and usage. It often includes installation instructions, usage examples, and links to more comprehensive documentation. Moreover, the README may contain guidelines for contributing to the project, specifying how users can report issues, propose changes, or adhere to coding conventions. It also mentions the project‚Äôs license, outlining how others can use and contribute to the code. Visual elements like badges may be added to display essential information such as build status, code coverage, or version numbers. In essence, a well-crafted README is instrumental in facilitating project understanding, user adoption, and collaboration within the GitHub community.\n\nPictured below is what your github profile will be if you do everything right.\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \nIn the next section, we will look at the steps taken to create a github README file for a github profile."

After entering the username, GitHub displays a message describing that you‚Äôre about to create a GitHub special repository.\n\n\n\nCheck the public checkbox under repository type to make the Github profile README visible to everyone who visits the Github profile page.

Once done with editing the README, you can go to the repo settings to change it‚Äôs visibilty to Public.\nCheck the Add a README file checkbox.

A special repository is created successfully. Go to the repository you just created and you‚Äôll see a README.md file added to the repository.\n\n\nIn the next few sections, we‚Äôll add contents to our README.md file. We‚Äôll use Github‚Äôs file editor to write and preview the changes. There are other text editor which you can use as well such as Vs Code Editor, Sublime Text, Atom etc. But making use of this editors, you will have to clone the repository on your local machine and run changes needed. You can look that up at your own free time.\nBut for this lesson, we shall be making use of Github file editor.

We‚Äôll add this copied link to an HTML img tag to display it in the Markdown file. We‚Äôre using the img tag as it‚Äôll help us specify the width of the image.\nIn the Github file editor, replace the README.md file content with the following code:\n    &lt;div id=\"header\" align=\"center\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9/giphy.gif\" width=\"100\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\nThe src attribute points to the URL we copied in the previous step. Since all the contents in this section are center-aligned, we‚Äôve wrapped the image in an HTML div tag with the align=\"center\" attribute.\nNote: Github converts the README Markdown to HTML and renders it on Github. After conversion, the HTML is sanitized, and for security reasons, it ignores certain HTML tags and attributes such as &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, &lt;style&gt; etc. For this reason, we‚Äôve used an align attribute instead of CSS.\nClick on the Preview tab, the picture below is what you will get. \n\nAdding Social Network Links/Badges to your Github profile README\nOn this section, we will be adding social network badges to your github profile readme. On clicking this badges, it redirects users or visitors to their respective social networking sites. Badges of various social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Medium(blog site), etc. But for this lessson, we shall only focus on two: LinkedIn and Twitter.\n\nTo get the respective badges for each social networks, we‚Äôll use shields.io which provides various endpoints letting users create and customize social medial badges. We‚Äôll use the  URL and pass additional parameters to this URL to get the respective social media badges.\n\nThe first parameter we will pass is Label(This represents the social network site name that will appear on the badge) and Color (which represents the color of the social network badge respectively).

    "text": "In this lesson, we will embark on a journey to create your very own profile page on github using Markdown, a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the web. Markdown is widely used because it allows you to maintain the readability of plain text while offering the styling capabilities of HTML. Our goal is to familiarize you with the foundational elements of Markdown to transform plain text into a rich, well-formatted document.\nThroughout the lesson, we will explore the basic constructs of Markdown, such as headers, emphasis, lists, links, and images, which will serve as the building blocks for your profile page. You will learn how to structure content with different levels of headings and how to emphasize text using bold and italic styles to make your page more engaging.\nAdditionally, we will delve into creating ordered and unordered lists to organize your skills and achievements in a visually appealing manner. We will also cover the process of incorporating hyperlinks and images, enabling you to link to projects or personal works and add a personal touch with your photo.\nBy the end of this lesson, you will have crafted a personal profile page that not only tells your story but also showcases your newfound Markdown skills. This profile can serve as a starting point for your portfolio, a personal webpage, or a GitHub README file, providing a snapshot of your professional persona to the world. As a hands-on approach to learning, you will actively engage in writing Markdown, receiving immediate visual feedback, and iterating on your design to create a compelling and informative profile page."

    "text": "How to customize a GitHub profile?\nCustomizing your GitHub profile is a great way to personalize your presence on the platform and highlight your work and interests. To get started, create or update a repository with the same name as your GitHub username. Within this repository, add a README.md file where you can provide information about yourself, your projects, and other details you want to showcase. You can use Markdown formatting to style your content, including text, images, links, and more. After customizing your README.md, commit your changes to the repository. Then, navigate to your repository‚Äôs settings, specifically the ‚ÄúGitHub Pages‚Äù section. Here, set the branch containing your README.md as the source, and save your settings. Your customized profile will now display your README.md content, allowing you to share your story and projects with the GitHub community. If desired, you can further personalize your profile by pinning repositories that you want to feature prominently. Remember that your GitHub profile is visible to the public, so make sure your customization represents you and your work effectively. This customization not only adds a personal touch to your GitHub presence but also serves as a valuable portfolio for potential collaborators and employers."

With GitHub Readme Stats, you can easily embed dynamic GitHub statistics directly into your README. Start by visiting the GitHub Readme Stats repository, copying the provided code snippet, and pasting it into your README.md file. Customize the code with your GitHub username and preferred options, then commit the changes. When someone views your README on GitHub, it will automatically fetch and display your GitHub statistics, enhancing your profile‚Äôs visibility. Another option is to use shields.io, a versatile badge generator service. You can access shields.io and select the GitHub category to create badges showcasing various GitHub statistics, such as followers, stars, or your latest commit. After configuring your badge, shields.io will generate a URL that you can embed in your README. Simply insert an image tag with the generated URL in your README.md, and the badge will appear, offering a quick snapshot of your GitHub activity."

Next, showcase your work by organizing sections with project thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and links to your repositories or deployed applications. Consider incorporating GitHub Readme Stats or widgets to display your GitHub activity, lending credibility to your contributions. List your skills and technologies to give viewers insight into your expertise. Highlight significant achievements and contributions, and provide contact information for networking and collaboration opportunities. Customize the appearance with Markdown or HTML for formatting and maintain a consistent theme. Keep your README updated as you embark on new projects or attain milestones, and encourage engagement from visitors by including a call to action. Don‚Äôt hesitate to infuse creativity through GIFs, emojis, or unique design elements. Lastly, review and proofread your README for clarity and accuracy, aiming to create a lasting and positive impression for those who explore your GitHub profile."

Simillar to HTML used in browsers, but lightweight, with syntax that's very readable and unobstrusive.\n\n\nWhy use Markdown ?\n\nMarkdown can be used for basically everything. It‚Äôs used to create websites, documents, notes, presentations and technical documentation.\nMarkdown is as beginner-friendly as it‚Äôs powerful.\nMarkdown is portable. Markdown-formatted text files can be opened using virtually any application.\nMarkdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.\nMarkdown is everywhere. It‚Äôs supported on GitHub, and lots of desktop and web-based applications.\nMarkdown is future proof. Even if the application you‚Äôre using stops working at some point in the future, you‚Äôll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.\n\nIn summary, Markdown is a handy, versatile text-formatting tool that you can use to create websites and other textbased documents, which you‚Äôll be using throughout your data science journey. Knowing how to use it will prove essential as you kickstart your journey."

    "text": "Lesson\n\nEmphasizing text in Markdown\n\nIn Markdown, the use of asterisks (*) or underscores (_) allows you to emphasize text by making it either italic or bold.\nTo make text italic, wrap it with a single asterisk or underscore on both sides: *italic* or _italic_.\nFor bold text, wrap it with double asterisks or underscores: **bold** or __bold__.\n\n\n\nHeadings in Markdown\n\nHeadings are created using hash (#) symbols. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading, with more hash symbols indicating a lower-level heading.\n# Heading 1: This is a top-level heading. It will be rendered as a large, bold heading.\n## Heading 2: This is a second-level heading. It is slightly smaller and less prominent than Heading 1.\n### Heading 3: This is a third-level heading. It is smaller than Heading 2 and is typically used for subsections or less important headings.\n\n\n\nLists in Markdown\n\nYou can create both unordered lists (bullet points) and ordered lists (numbered items)\n\n\nUnordered list\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n\nOrdered list\n1. Ordered Item 1\n2. Ordered Item 2\n\n\n\nCode blocks in Markdown\n\nTo indicate code blocks, use three backticks before and after the block of code.\n\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\nOther common rules\n\nHorizontal Rule\n\nYou can create a horizontal rule by using three consecutive hyphens (‚Äî) or three consecutive asterisks (***).\n\n--- or ***\n\n\nLinks\n[title](https://www.example.com)\n\n\nImages\n![alt text](image.jpg)"

I found this GIF on Giphy, which is full of free GIFs to use.\nGo to the GIF Link and click on the Share button and then Copy GIF Link. We‚Äôll add this copied link to an HTML img tag to display it in the Markdown file. We‚Äôre using the img tag as it‚Äôll help us specify the width of the image.\nIn the Github file editor, replace the README.md file content with the following code:\n    &lt;div id=\"header\" align=\"center\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hpXdHPfFI5wTABdDx9/giphy.gif\" width=\"100\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\nThe src attribute points to the URL we copied in the previous step. Since all the contents in this section are center-aligned, we‚Äôve wrapped the image in an HTML div tag with the align=\"center\" attribute.\nNote: Github converts the README Markdown to HTML and renders it on Github. After conversion, the HTML is sanitized, and for security reasons, it ignores certain HTML tags and attributes such as &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, &lt;style&gt; etc. For this reason, we‚Äôve used an align attribute instead of CSS.\nClick on the Preview tab, the picture below is what you will get. \n\nAdding Social Network Links/Badges to your Github profile README\nOn this section, we will be adding social network badges to your github profile readme. On clicking this badges, it redirects users or visitors to their respective social networking sites. Badges of various social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Medium(blog site), etc. But for this lessson, we shall only focus on two: LinkedIn and Twitter.\n\nTo get the respective badges for each social networks, we‚Äôll use shields.io which provides various endpoints letting users create and customize social medial badges. We‚Äôll use the  URL and pass additional parameters to this URL to get the respective social media badges.\n\nThe first parameter we will pass is Label(This represents the social network site name that will appear on the badge) and Color (which represents the color of the social network badge respectively). Label-Color\n\nIn the case of our example being LinkedIn and Twitter, their color will be blue.\nWhen the parameters listed above (Label and color) are combined with https://img.shields.io/badge/, the following URL is created."

    "text": "What is R?\nR is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman designed for statistical programming. It is primarily focused on data wrangling and visualization.\nAs the phrase ‚Äúprogramming language‚Äù suggests, R is a language used to instruct a computer to carry out complex commands. Like most any other language you will need to understand its grammar and syntax in order to fluently ‚Äúspeak‚Äù it. The more fluent you become in it, the easier it will be for you to communicate your wants and desires to it.\n\n\nInstalling R\n\nGo to cloud.r-project.org\nClick on the download link for your computer system. For example if you are using a windows computer click ‚ÄúDownload R for Windows‚Äù\nClick on ‚Äúbase‚Äù\nClick on the download version for the current version of R. (At time of writing the button says ‚ÄúDownload R-4.3.1 for Windows‚Äù on a windows computer.) Make sure you know where you save the downloaded file so that you can run the installer.\nNavigate to the downloaded file and run the installer by double clicking. (Usually it is title something like ‚ÄúR-4.3.1-win‚Äù) Follow the steps for the installation wizard. It is highly recommended you just keep the recommended installation settings especially if you haven‚Äôt done this before.\nR should now be properly installed. We‚Äôll show you how to check it properly in the next tutorial ‚ÄúInstalling R Studio‚Äù"

Markdown is widely used because it allows you to maintain the readability of plain text while offering the styling capabilities of HTML. Our goal is to familiarize you with the foundational elements of Markdown to transform plain text into a rich, well-formatted document.\nThroughout the lesson, we will explore the basic constructs of Markdown, such as headers, emphasis, lists, links, and images, which will serve as the building blocks for your profile page. You will learn how to structure content with different levels of headings and how to emphasize text using bold and italic styles to make your page more engaging.\nAdditionally, we will delve into creating ordered and unordered lists to organize your skills and achievements in a visually appealing manner. We will also cover the process of incorporating hyperlinks and images, enabling you to link to projects or personal works and add a personal touch with your photo.\nBy the end of this lesson, you will have crafted a personal profile page that not only tells your story but also showcases your newfound Markdown skills. This profile can serve as a starting point for your portfolio, a personal webpage, or a GitHub README file, providing a snapshot of your professional persona to the world. As a hands-on approach to learning, you will actively engage in writing Markdown, receiving immediate visual feedback, and iterating on your design to create a compelling and informative profile page."
