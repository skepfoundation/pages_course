    "text": "Task 1 - Creating Your First Github Repo\nGit is the world’s most popular version control system and Github is the most popular site for hosting code using git in the cloud. As a version control system, Git helps you keep your coding project files organized by keeping a record of when you edited files and tags them with short notes about what changes were made in the last iteration. This is particularly helpful when you are colaborating on a project with other programmers and need to stay tidy while working on the same files.\nGithub is a free web service for storing your version controlled code in the cloud. It allows you to access your code from anywhere and it provides a handy interface for tracking your code’s changes over time. It also happens to have a handy service for hosting static websites for free on their platform.\nIn this task you will create a github account, create a repository, and clone that repository onto your local machine in Rstudio.\n\nDetails"

    "text": "Lesson\n\nA Quarto Overview\nQuarto is a dynamic open-source publishing system made to simplify the process of creating easily reproducible reports, articles, research,HTML, and other print and non-print documents. It is built on top of the exceptionally powerful Pandoc converter and uses a language syntax very similar to R markdown and other flavours of markdown.\nUnlike R markdown, Quarto is not tied to a specific language, infact it was made to be multi-lingual. As such, it supports Python, Julia, and Observable among others. The benefits of Quarto can be summarized as:\n\nDynamic Documents: Like R Markdown, Quarto allows you to create dynamic documents where you can embed code, text, and visualizations.\nMultilingual Support: Quarto supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for different types of analysis. It’s not limited to R; you can use Python, Julia, and more.\nInteractive Documents: Quarto supports interactive documents with features like interactive graphics and code blocks. The document output can be PDF, EPUB, HTML, DOC, etcetera.\nReproducibility and Collaboration: Quarto emphasizes reproducibility by capturing the code, data, and dependencies needed to reproduce the document’s content. This makes it a powerful way for people to collaborate on projects as everyone can view everything about a report on a single doument.\n\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://quarto.org/\nhttps://www.infoworld.com/article/3666743/\nhttps://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/\nhttps://appsilon.com/interactive-clinical-reports-shiny-and-quarto/\n\n\n\n\nStep 01: Find and Download Quarto\n\n\n\nQuarto Download Page\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Quarto download page.\nOr use this link to access a static download.\nFor windows, click on the large blue link at the top of the page and the download should start.\nFor Mac OS, scroll down and click on the download link for Mac OS.\n\n\n\nStep 02: Install Quarto (For Windows)\n\nClick on the downloaded msi file. The setup wizard will start.\n\n\n\nClick next.\nIf you want all users on your computer to have access to Quarto select the radio button beside Install for all users of this machine, else, change nothing and just click next.\n\n\n\nClick next.\nLeave the install path as the default.\n\n\n\nClick next.\nThe installation will start. Wait for it to complete (Please do not turn of your system)\nWhen a message comes up, click on Finish.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations 🎉😎\nYou have successfully installed Quarto\n\n\nStep 3: Enable Quarto Extension in VScode\n\nOpen vscode and click on the Extensions widget on the left panel of vscode.\n\n\n\nSearch for Quarto and click on the blue install button.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Rendering/Previewing Quarto files\n\nCreate a quarto file by clicking the file at the top-left in vscode and then selecting New File.. from the drop-down.\nFrom the new drop-down, select Quarto Document. A new untitled quarto document will be created with the following content:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat: html\n---\n\nEdit and add content to your quarto file to make it look like this:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My First Quarto Code\"\nformat: html\n---\n\n### My name is {type your name here}\nI just finished installing quarto on **{input the date here}**\n\nClick on the preview button on the top-right of vscode. A dialog will pop up.\nName your file test.qmd (qmd is the file extension name for a quarto file) and click on save.\nClick the preview button again. A few things will run in the terminal. A preview panel will open on the right of vscode. The result should resemble the picture below (Except the name and date will be different)."

    "section": "Lesson",
    "text": "Lesson\n\nWhy Markdown Matters ?\n\nMarkdown can be used for basically everything. It’s used to create websites, documents, notes, presentations and technical documentation.\nMarkdown is as beginner-friendly as it’s powerful, portable and platform independent. It can be created on any device running any operating system, using virtually any application.\nMarkdown is everywhere. It’s supported on GitHub, and lots of desktop and web-based applications.\nMarkdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.\n\nIn short, Markdown is a handy, versatile text-formatting tool that you can use to create websites and other textbased documents, which you’ll be using throughout your data science journey. Knowing how to use it will prove essential as you kickstart your journey.\n\n\nEmphasizing text in Markdown\n\nIn Markdown, the use of asterisks (*) or underscores (_) allows you to emphasize text by making it either italic or bold.\nTo make text italic, wrap it with a single asterisk or underscore on both sides: *italic* or _italic_.\nFor bold text, wrap it with double asterisks or underscores: **bold** or __bold__.\n\n\n\nHeadings in Markdown\n\nHeadings are created using hash (#) symbols. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading, with more hash symbols indicating a lower-level heading.\n# Heading 1: This is a top-level heading. It will be rendered as a large, bold heading.\n## Heading 2: This is a second-level heading. It is slightly smaller and less prominent than Heading 1.\n### Heading 3: This is a third-level heading. It is smaller than Heading 2 and is typically used for subsections or less important headings.\n\n\n\nLists in Markdown\n\nYou can create both unordered lists (bullet points) and ordered lists (numbered items)\n\n\nUnordered list\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n\nOrdered list\n1. Ordered Item 1\n2. Ordered Item 2\n\n\n\nCode blocks in Markdown\n\nTo indicate code blocks, use three backticks before and after the block of code. As such: ```python \"insert python code\" ```\n\nYou can do this with any coding language. The output will look like this:\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\nOther common rules\n\nHorizontal Rule\n\nYou can create a horizontal rule by using three consecutive hyphens (—) or three consecutive asterisks (***).\n\n--- or ***\n\n\nLinks\n\nTo create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses. As such: [link text](https://www.example.com)\n\nThe rendered output looks like this: My example link is example\n\n\nImages\n\nTo add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. As such: ![alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n\nA River"

Double check to make sure the email address is valid and that you have access to it. It is reccomended that you do not use a business or school email that you wll lose access to in the future. Pick an email address that you can access for years to come.\nWhen the continue button turns green, tap it.\nA new section will appear prompting you to input a password. Make sure to follow the password guidelines that will appear at the bottom of the password input area.\nAgain, click on the green continue button.\nA new section will appear prompting you to input a username. Follow the username guidelines that will appear at the bottom of the username input area.\nWhile you do not have to use your real name, please bear in mind that any username you enter is immutable, you WILL NOT HAVE THE OPTION to change it later. A good Github username is one that is easily searchable. This means it should not include long, random strings of characters, include overly long or complex numbers, and ideally it is easy to spell when the name is heard phonetically. The username you choose will be searchable and viewable by the public, so make sure it is a name you would like to be associated with your professional brand, now and in the future.\nClick on the green continue button.\nA prompt will appear asking if you want to receive announcements via email. If you are okay with receiving product emails and announcements from GitHub, enter the letter y, if not, enter the letter n in the input area provided.\nClick on the green continue button\n\n\n\n\nResults of Step 02.\n\n\n\n\nStep 03: Verifying your account\n\n\nA new section will drop down asking you to verify your account. Click on the word Verify. It should turn green when you hover over it.\nYou will be given a verification puzzle to make sure you are not a robot. The verification challenge will likely be a picture of a pointing hand on the left, and a picture of an object on the right. The challenge is to use the ⬅ and ➡ buttons which are below the picture of the object to position it to face in the direction the hand is pointing.\nYou may have one or two more similar challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Verification Pictures\n\n\n\nWhen you are done with the challenges a check mark ✅ will appear.\n\n\n\nNow click on the green create account button that will be at the bottom of the screen.\nA code will be sent to the email address you entered previously.\nOpen you email account and refresh your inbox. You should see a message from GitHub.\nIf after a while, you still do not see an email from GitHub, go back to the webpage and tap the link below the Enter code section labeled Resend the code. This will prompt Github to send a new message to your email.\nWhen you receive the email, open it and take note of the numbers there.\nReturn to the Github webpage and input the numbers into the boxes provided.\n\n\n\nIf you have entered the numbers correctly, a new webpage will appear.\n\n\n\nStep 04: Final Setup\n\nYou may be asked two questions:\n\nHow many team members will be working with you?\n\nFor this question choose the option 2-5.\n\nAre you a student or teacher?\n\nFor this question choose the option student if you are a student. Choose N/A if you are neither a student nor a teacher.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new webpage will appear asking you some questions. Just click the continue button found at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\nYou may see a new webpage with two sections, one labelled Free and the other Get Student Benefits.\nFor now, go to the bottom of the page and click Continue for free, even if you are a student. You can get student benefits later.\n\n\n\nWoohoo!! Your Github dashboard should now be open.\n\n\n\n\nStep 05: Edit Profile Picture\nYour profile picture is one of the first things visitors to your Github account will see. Make sure your picture is clean, clear, and professional. However, you do not have to dress in formal attire.\nTo edit your profile picture, do the following while in your github dashboard:\n\nClick on the round picture frame on the top right-hand corner. A panel will open with your username at the top.\n\n\n\nClick on Your Profile. You will be directed to a new webpage with a bigger picture frame on the left.\n\n\n\nClick on the picture frame. Again you will be taken to yet another webpage but with the picture frame on the right side of the screen. Notice that the picture frame has an edit button on the bottom left.\n\n\n\nClick on the edit buttom. It will reveal an upload button. Click on that and it will bring up a dialog box where you can upload a profile picture that meets the criteria discussed at the beginning of Step 05.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations 🎉😎, You have successfully created a GitHub Account and uploaded an appropriate Profile picture!"

It’s also a great place to meet like-minded individuals and grow your network!\nYou will be assigned a data science mentor who can help you with your assignments. Discord will be your primary tool for interacting.\n\n\nCourse Outcomes\n\nWhat you will know by the end\nBy the end of this course you should know how to build a basic, static website using R and hosted for free on Github. You will know how to customize your website and how to add cool things like embedded pictures and videos, interactive charts, and direct links to social platforms like facebook and twitter.\n\nYou will know how to use Github for version control of future coding projects.\nYou will know how to use the R programming language to generate plots and manage data from a variety of sources.\nYou will know how to use Quarto to publish professional reports including websites.\n\n\n\nWhat you will not know by the end\nWhile we hope you feel you can create a custom website from scratch by the end of this course, there will still be some things you won’t be able to do by the end.\n\nYou won’t be able to create a dynamic website. A dynamic website is where the contents of the site react differently to each individual user on the site. (Like facebook, google, or youtube)\nYou won’t known the ins and outs of data science skills like data wrangling or machine learning. (These are saved for future courses)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe truly hope you enjoy this course and that it serves you on your data science journey. This course is designed to teach you the basic skills you will need to succeed as a data scientist. We do this through a lens of learning how to create websites but with the primary intent of giving you transferable skills to succeed in the world of data science."

If you don’t want users to see your Github profile README while it’s still in development, you can choose Private. Once done with editing the README, you can go to the repo settings to change it’s visibilty to Public.\nCheck the Add a README file checkbox.

Serving as the front page of a repository, it offers a concise yet informative introduction to the project. The README’s primary purpose is to provide an overview of the project’s purpose, features, and usage. It often includes installation instructions, usage examples, and links to more comprehensive documentation. Moreover, the README may contain guidelines for contributing to the project, specifying how users can report issues, propose changes, or adhere to coding conventions. It also mentions the project’s license, outlining how others can use and contribute to the code. Visual elements like badges may be added to display essential information such as build status, code coverage, or version numbers. In essence, a well-crafted README is instrumental in facilitating project understanding, user adoption, and collaboration within the GitHub community."

    "text": "How to customize a GitHub profile?\nCustomizing your GitHub profile is a great way to personalize your presence on the platform and highlight your work and interests. To get started, create or update a repository with the same name as your GitHub username. Within this repository, add a README.md file where you can provide information about yourself, your projects, and other details you want to showcase. You can use Markdown formatting to style your content, including text, images, links, and more. After customizing your README.md, commit your changes to the repository. Then, navigate to your repository’s settings, specifically the “GitHub Pages” section. Here, set the branch containing your README.md as the source, and save your settings. Your customized profile will now display your README.md content, allowing you to share your story and projects with the GitHub community. If desired, you can further personalize your profile by pinning repositories that you want to feature prominently. Remember that your GitHub profile is visible to the public, so make sure your customization represents you and your work effectively. This customization not only adds a personal touch to your GitHub presence but also serves as a valuable portfolio for potential collaborators and employers.\nIn the next lesson, we’ll understand markdown more so that you can format your GitHub profile readme just how you like it.\nPictured below is what your github profile will be if you do everything right."

Begin with a brief introduction, including your name, role, and a touch of personalization to make it relatable. Use a professional photo to humanize your profile.\nNext, showcase your work by organizing sections with project thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and links to your repositories or deployed applications. Consider incorporating GitHub Readme Stats or widgets to display your GitHub activity, lending credibility to your contributions. List your skills and technologies to give viewers insight into your expertise. Highlight significant achievements and contributions, and provide contact information for networking and collaboration opportunities.\nCustomize the appearance with Markdown or HTML for formatting and maintain a consistent theme. Keep your README updated as you embark on new projects or attain milestones, and encourage engagement from visitors by including a call to action. Don’t hesitate to infuse creativity through GIFs, emojis, or unique design elements. Lastly, review and proofread your README for clarity and accuracy, aiming to create a lasting and positive impression for those who explore your GitHub profile."

It is primarily focused on data wrangling and visualization.\nAs the phrase “programming language” suggests, R is a language used to instruct a computer to carry out complex commands. Like most any other language you will need to understand its grammar and syntax in order to fluently “speak” it. The more fluent you become in it, the easier it will be for you to communicate your wants and desires to it.\n\n\nInstalling R\n\nGo to cloud.r-project.org\nClick on the download link for your computer system. For example if you are using a windows computer click “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on the download version for the current version of R. (At time of writing the button says “Download R-4.3.1 for Windows” on a windows computer.) Make sure you know where you save the downloaded file so that you can run the installer.\nNavigate to the downloaded file and run the installer by double clicking. (Usually it is title something like “R-4.3.1-win”) Follow the steps for the installation wizard. It is highly recommended you just keep the recommended installation settings especially if you haven’t done this before.\nR should now be properly installed. We’ll show you how to check it properly in the next tutorial “Installing R Studio”"
