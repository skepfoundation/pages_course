    "text": "Task 1 - Creating Your First Github Repo\nGit is the world’s most popular version control system and Github is the most popular site for hosting code using git in the cloud. As a version control system, Git helps you keep your coding project files organized by keeping a record of when you edited files and tags them with short notes about what changes were made in the last iteration. This is particularly helpful when you are colaborating on a project with other programmers and need to stay tidy while working on the same files.\nGithub is a free web service for storing your version controlled code in the cloud. It allows you to access your code from anywhere and it provides a handy interface for tracking your code’s changes over time. It also happens to have a handy service for hosting static websites for free on their platform.\nIn this task you will create a github account, create a repository, and clone that repository onto your local machine in Rstudio."

    "text": "Lesson\n\nWhat is Visual Studio Code ?\n\nVisual Studio Code is a Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. An integrated development environment or IDE is a software for building applications. An IDE is just like a text editor except instead of writing documents you’re writing source-code. Visual Studio Code includes features such as syntax highlighting, error highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, install extensions that add functionality, and has support for different programming languages.\n\nSyntax Highlighting\nTo improve readability for developers, VS Code has syntax highlighting. What this means, is that special keywords of the programming language are highlighted in different colors so that the developer can quickly differentiate these keywords from other texts. For example, if you’re writing Python code without syntax highlighting, it could be harder to identify keywords from other texts. With syntax highlighting, that gets much easier because the Python keywords and variables are colored differently.\n\n\n\nError Highlighting\nJust like checking spelling in a text document, IDEs can highlight mistakes you make in your programming code. For example, if I delete the equal symbol where it’s needed, my IDE will highlight the error.\n\n\nIntelligent Code Completion\nWhen you’re typing a message on your phone, it suggests words as you type. Visual Studio Code’s code completion is a similar feature. Since programming languages have special keywords, it can offer suggestions to autocomplete words as you start typing them. Together with IntelliSense, this makes the IDE smart and even able to understand your code. They can detect variables and functions and offer them as suggestions during autocomplete. For example, if I have a Python function named myFunction defined at the top of the Python file, then as soon as I start typing the letter m my IDE suggest this function as an autocompletion. This speeds up the process of coding applications by reducing typos and other common mistakes.\n\n\n\nCode Refactoring\nSince IDEs understand your code, they can help you if you need to change it. To demonstrate how refactoring works, let’s continue with the myFunction function that I defined a moment ago. In the code, the function is then called multiple times. It can also be called in the code of other files too. But what if you need to rename this function? You would need to rename it in every file that uses the function ensuring that you update those files to use the new name. This process is known as refactoring, changing the structure of the code without changing the functionality. Doing this manually is very time consuming and prone to error. If you mistyped the new function name in one place, the application will break. Since the IDE understand your code, it can assist with refactoring and automatically update the function name across all files.\n\n\nSnippets\nCode snippets are small blocks of reusable code that you can add to a code file by using the right-click context menu command or a combination of hotkeys. This saves time and ensures consistency on routine operations. Snippets make it easier to remember specific formatting for functions and can be shared amomg a team to ensure no one is doubling down on the same work.\n\n\n\nGit\nGit is a version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among developers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. You’ll learn more on Git in Lesson 3. For now, it’s good to know that Visual Studio code has built-in support for Git through Source Control and the terminal.\n\nVS Code has a host of extensions and plugins that add various functionality to aid rapid software development."

    "section": "Lesson",
    "text": "Lesson\n\nWhy Markdown Matters ?\nMarkdown is an incredibly important yet incredibly basic formatting language. Here are a few of the reasons why it matters:\n\nMarkdown can be used for basically everything. It’s used to create websites, documents, notes, presentations and technical documentation.\nMarkdown is as beginner-friendly as it’s powerful, portable and platform independent. It can be created on any device running any operating system, using virtually any application.\nMarkdown is everywhere. It’s supported on GitHub, and lots of desktop and web-based applications.\nMarkdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.\n\nIn short, Markdown is a handy, versatile text-formatting tool that you can use to create websites and other text-based documents, which you’ll be using throughout your computer science journey. Knowing how to use it will prove essential as you kickstart your journey.\n\n\nEmphasizing text in Markdown\n\nIn Markdown, the use of asterisks (*) or underscores (_) allows you to emphasize text by making it either italic or bold.\nTo make text italic, wrap it with a single asterisk or underscore on both sides: *italic* or _italic_.\nFor bold text, wrap it with double asterisks or underscores: **bold** or __bold__.\n\n\n\nHeadings in Markdown\n\nHeadings are created using hash (#) symbols. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading, with more hash symbols indicating a lower-level heading.\n# Heading 1: This is a top-level heading. It will be rendered as a large, bold heading.\n## Heading 2: This is a second-level heading. It is slightly smaller and less prominent than Heading 1.\n### Heading 3: This is a third-level heading. It is smaller than Heading 2 and is typically used for subsections or less important headings.\n\n\n\nLists in Markdown\n\nYou can create both unordered lists (bullet points) and ordered lists (numbered items)\n\n\nUnordered list\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n\nOrdered list\n1. Ordered Item 1\n2. Ordered Item 2\n\n\n\nCode blocks in Markdown\n\nTo indicate code blocks, use three backticks before and after the block of code. As such:\n\n``` python \n\"insert python code\" \n``` \nYou can do this with any coding language. The output will look like this:\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\nOther common rules\n\nHorizontal Rule\n\nYou can create a horizontal rule by using three consecutive hyphens (—) or three consecutive asterisks (***).\n\n--- or ***\nThis will produce a horizontal line break in your text like the following:\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nTo create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses. As such: [example](https://www.example.com)\n\nThe rendered output looks like this: My example link is example\n\n\nImages\n\nTo add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. As such: ![alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n\nA River"

Double check to make sure the email address is valid and that you have access to it.\nIf the continue button turns green, tap it.\nA new section will appear prompting you to input a password. Make sure to follow the password guidelines that will appear at the bottom of the password input area.\nAgain, click on the green continue button.\nA new section will appear prompting you to input a username. Follow the username guidelines that will appear at the bottom of the username input area.\nWhile you do not have to use your real name, please bear in mind that any username you enter is immutable, you WILL NOT HAVE THE OPTION to change it later. A good Github username is one that is easily searchable. This means it will not include long, random string of characters, it will not include overly long or complex numbers, and ideally it is easy to spell when the name is heard phonetically. The username you choose will be searchable and viewable by the public, so make sure it is a name you would like to be associated with your professional brand, now and in the future.\nClick on the green continue button.\nA prompt will appear asking if you want to receive annoucements via email.

The challenge is to use the ⬅ and ➡ buttons which are below the picture of an animal to position the animal to face in the direction the hand is pointing.\n\n\n\nYou may have one or two of a similar challenge.\n\n\n\nWhen you are done with the challenge a check mark ✅ will appear.\nNow click on the green create account button that will be at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nA code will be sent to the email address you entered previously.\nOpen you email account and refresh your inbox. You should see a message from Github.\nIf after a while, you still do not see an email from Github, go back to the webpage and tap the link below the Enter code section. The link will be named Resend the code. This will prompt Github to send a new message to your email.\nWhen you receive the email, open it and take note of the numbers there.\nReturn to the Github webpage and input the numbers into the boxes provided.\n\n\n\nIf you have entered the numbers correctly, a new webpage will appear.\n\n\n\nStep 04: Final Setup\n\nYou will be asked two questions\n\nHow many team members will be working with you?\n\nFor this question choose the option 2-5.\n\nAre you a student or teacher?\n\nFor this question choose the option student if you are a student. Choose N/A if you are neither a student nor a teacher.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new webpage will appear asking you some questions. Just click the continue button found at the bottom of the page. \nYou will see a new webpage with two sections, one labelled Free and the other Get Student Benefits.\n\n\n\nFor now, go to the bottom of the page and click Continue for free, even if you are a student. You can get student benefits later.\n\n\n\nWoohoo!! Your Github dashboard should now be open.\n\n\n\n\nStep 05: Edit Profile Picture\nYour profile picture is one of the first things visitors to your Github account will see. Make sure your picture is clean, clear, and professional. However, you do not have to dress in formal attire.\nTo edit your profile picture, do the following while in your github dashboard: - Click on the round picture frame on the top right-hand corner. A panel will open with your username at the top.\n\n\nClick on Your Profile. You will be directed to a new webpage with a bigger picture frame on the left.\n\n\n\nClick on the picture frame. Again you will be taken to yet another webpage but with the picture frame on the right side of the screen. Notice that the picture frame has an edit button on the bottom left.\n\n\n\nClick on the edit buttom. It will reveal an upload button. Click on that and it will bring up a dialog box where you can upload a profile picture that meets the criteria discussed at the beginning of Step 05.\n\n\nCongratulations 🎉😎, You have successfully created a GitHub Account and uploaded an appropriate Profile picture!"

    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to GitHub Pages Training, a course designed to take you from complete beginner to a website creating machine! In this course we will walk through the basics of using Github, R, and Quarto for website development. If you don’t know what any of those are, that is OK. We’ll teach you! Just know this, we will collectively use those tools to develop free websites. Along the way you will pick up the fundamental data science skills used by professionals every day.\n\n\nRequired Experience\nThis course assumes that you have no technical experience with website creation, programming, or using GitHub. It does however assume that you have a basic understanding of how to navigate a computer and its file management system.\nYou will be well served by knowing how to find answers to your questions through a search engine like Google. Many say that the best programmers are really just the best googlers.\nSome excellent websites where people post questions and answers to common programming questions are Stack Overflow and GitHub.\n\n\nRequired Materials\nYou will need access to the following materials to complete this course:\n\nA computer with at least 8GB of RAM\nA stable internet connection\nA discord account with access to our discord server\n\n\n\nCourse Structure\nThis course is designed to allow you to complete learning assignments on your own but with some healthy support from our data science team. We will meet for whole team check-ins once a week virtually through zoom. Additionally, we will have a discord server where you can post questions, pictures of your class projects, and assist other learners in our community.\nYou are expected to interact on that discord server over the duration of the course both for your benefit and the benefit of your peers. It’s also a great place to meet like-minded individuals and grow your network!\nYou will be assigned a data science mentor who can help you with your assignments. Discord will be your primary tool for interacting.\n\n\nCourse Outcomes\n\nWhat you will know by the end\nBy the end of this course you should know how to build a basic, static website using R and hosted for free on Github. You will know how to customize your website and how to add cool things like embedded pictures and videos, interactive charts, and direct links to social platforms like facebook and twitter.\n\nYou will know how to use Github for version control of future coding projects.\nYou will know how to use the R programming language to generate plots and manage data from a variety of sources.\nYou will know how to use Quarto to publish professional reports including websites.\n\n\n\nWhat you will not know by the end\nWhile we hope you feel you can create a custom website from scratch by the end of this course, there will still be some things you won’t be able to do by the end.\n\nYou won’t be able to create a dynamic website. A dynamic website is where the contents of the site react differently to each individual user on the site. (Like facebook, google, or youtube)\nYou won’t known the ins and outs of data science skills like data wrangling or machine learning. (These are saved for future courses)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe truly hope you enjoy this course and that it serves you on your data science journey. This course is designed to teach you the basic skills you will need to succeed as a data scientist. We do this through a lens of learning how to create websites but with the primary intent of giving you transferable skills to succeed in the world of data science."

In the Repository name field, enter your GitHub username. After entering your username, GitHub displays a message describing that you’re about to create a GitHub special repository.\n\nFor example, if your username is octocat, you would create a repository named octocat.\n\n\nCheck the public checkbox under repository type to make the Github profile README visible to everyone who visits the Github profile page. If you don’t want users to see your Github profile README while it’s still in development, you can choose Private. Once done with editing the README, you can go to the repo settings to change it’s visibilty to Public.\nCheck the Add a README file checkbox. This will add a README.md file where we’ll add the profile contents. The field values should look similar to the image below.\n\n\n\nClick on the Create repository button. A special repository is created successfully. Go to the repository you just created by clicking your profile picture, then “Your repositories”, and then the repository named after your GitHub profile. You’ll see a README.md file added to the repository.\n\n\nIn the next few sections, we’ll add contents to our README.md file. We’ll use Github’s file editor to write and preview the changes. There are other text editor which you can use as well such as Vs Code Editor, Sublime Text, Atom etc. But for this lesson, we shall be making use of Github file editor.\nOpen the README.md file and click on the Edit this file icon (a pencil icon) on the top right of the repo page.

On the right is the code used to make the section on the right. Copy the code and put it into your profile, editing it as needed to fit you.\n\n\nGenerally, A GitHub README is a document that typically accompanies a GitHub repository, providing essential information about the repository and its contents. It’s named “README” because it’s often the first thing a visitor should read to understand what the project is about. The importance of a GitHub README cannot be overstated, as it serves several critical functions, but we will only talk about 3 in this lesson.\nKey Features and Importance of a GitHub README:\n\nProject Introduction: It introduces the project to users, developers, or potential contributors. This is where you provide an overview of what the project does and its purpose.\nDocumentation: The README often contains documentation on how to install, configure, and use the project. This can include code examples, configuration settings, and command-line instructions.\nTechnical Details: It may provide technical details such as the technology stack, dependencies, and system requirements.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of creating a GitHub profile, a GitHub README serves as a personalized introduction and overview of a user’s GitHub presence. Unlike a repository-specific README that focuses on a particular project, a GitHub profile README provides a broader view of the user, their interests, skills, and contributions.\nKey Features and Importance of a Github Profile README:\n\nPersonal Introduction: A brief section about who you are, what you do, and your interests. This can include your professional role, educational background, or areas of expertise.\nSkills and Technologies: Highlight the programming languages, tools, and technologies you are proficient in. This can be done through text, badges, or icons.\nProjects and Work: Showcase your significant or favorite projects. You can include links to repositories, descriptions of what each project entails, and any notable achievements.\nGitHub Statistics: Some users include dynamic GitHub stats like their number of contributions, most used languages, or streaks. This can be done using GitHub widgets and badges."

It is built on top of the exceptionally powerful Pandoc converter and uses a language syntax very similar to R markdown and other flavours of markdown.\nUnlike R markdown, Quarto is not tied to a specific language, infact it was made to be multi-lingual. As such, it supports Python, Julia, and Observable among others. The benefits of Quarto can be summarized as:\n\nDynamic Documents: Like R Markdown, Quarto allows you to create dynamic documents where you can embed code, text, and visualizations.\nMultilingual Support: Quarto supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for different types of analysis. It’s not limited to R; you can use Python, Julia, and more.\nInteractive Documents: Quarto supports interactive documents with features like interactive graphics and code blocks. The document output can be PDF, EPUB, HTML, DOC, etcetera.\nReproducibility and Collaboration: Quarto emphasizes reproducibility by capturing the code, data, and dependencies needed to reproduce the document’s content. This makes it a powerful way for people to collaborate on projects as everyone can view everything about a report on a single doument.\n\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://quarto.org/\nhttps://www.infoworld.com/article/3666743/\nhttps://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/\nhttps://appsilon.com/interactive-clinical-reports-shiny-and-quarto/\n\n\n\n\nStep 01: Find and Download Quarto\n\n\n\nQuarto Download Page\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Quarto download page.\nOr use this link to access a static download.\nFor windows, click on the large blue link at the top of the page and the download should start.\nFor Mac OS, scroll down and click on the download link for Mac OS.\n\n\n\nStep 02: Install Quarto (For Windows)\n\nClick on the downloaded msi file. The setup wizard will start.\n\n\n\nClick next.\nIf you want all users on your computer to have access to Quarto select the radio button beside Install for all users of this machine, else, change nothing and just click next.\n\n\n\nClick next.\nLeave the install path as the default.\n\n\n\nClick next.\nThe installation will start. Wait for it to complete (Please do not turn of your system)\nWhen a message comes up, click on Finish.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations 🎉😎\nYou have successfully installed Quarto\n\n\nStep 3: Enable Quarto Extension in VScode\n\nOpen vscode and click on the Extensions widget on the left panel of vscode.\n\n\n\nSearch for Quarto and click on the blue install button.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Rendering/Previewing Quarto files\n\nCreate a quarto file by clicking the file at the top-left in vscode and then selecting New File.. from the drop-down.\nFrom the new drop-down, select Quarto Document. A new untitled quarto document will be created with the following content:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat: html\n---\n\nEdit and add content to your quarto file to make it look like this:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My First Quarto Code\"\nformat: html\n---\n\n### My name is {type your name here}\nI just finished installing quarto on **{input the date here}**\n\nClick on the preview button on the top-right of vscode. A dialog will pop up.\nName your file test.qmd (qmd is the file extension name for a quarto file) and click on save.\nClick the preview button again. A few things will run in the terminal. A preview panel will open on the right of vscode. The result should resemble the picture below (Except the name and date will be different)."

    "text": "What is R?\nR is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman designed for statistical programming. It is primarily focused on data wrangling and visualization.\nAs the phrase “programming language” suggests, R is a language used to instruct a computer to carry out complex commands. Like most any other language you will need to understand its grammar and syntax in order to fluently “speak” it. The more fluent you become in it, the easier it will be for you to communicate your wants and desires to it.\n\n\nInstalling R\n\nGo to cloud.r-project.org\nClick on the download link for your computer system. For example if you are using a windows computer click “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on the download version for the current version of R. (At time of writing the button says “Download R-4.3.1 for Windows” on a windows computer.) Make sure you know where you save the downloaded file so that you can run the installer.\nNavigate to the downloaded file and run the installer by double clicking. (Usually it is title something like “R-4.3.1-win”) Follow the steps for the installation wizard. It is highly recommended you just keep the recommended installation settings especially if you haven’t done this before.\nR should now be properly installed. We’ll show you how to check it properly in the next tutorial “Installing R Studio”"
