## What is Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a __Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE)__ developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. An integrated development environment or IDE is a software for building applications. An IDE is just like a text editor except instead of writing documents you're writing source-code.
Visual Studio Code includes features to aid rapid application build. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, install extensions that add functionality, and has support for different programming languages.
